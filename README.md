Description   Rail NL case
In the Netherlands, a lot of stations exist. Between many stations, connections exist, in the form of railways.
As many dutch people have to travel through the country on a daily basis, it is important to set up a good Train system in order to connect all places as efficiently as possible.

Our job is to set up maximally 7 trajects, first through two provinces only, and then through all of the Netherlands.
A Traject is defined as a set of connections with a maximal total time of 120 minutes. All connections that include Critical stations are considered critical and will yield extra points in our objective function.


The quality of our Trainsystem can be calculated by the following objective function:
K = p*10000 - (T*20 + Min/10)

K; quality
p; fraction of critical connections used
T; amount of trajects (between 1 and 7)
Min; total minutes of the train system


As were dealing with many stations and many possibilities build trajects, we've set up the following statespace:

u = (s * c_1 * (c_2)^a_m)^t

waarin
u de upper bound is
s het aantal stations is
c_1 het maximum aantal connecties is
c_2 het maximum aantal connecties is als je niet terug reist
a_m het aantal connecties dat maximaal in 2 uur past
t het maximale aantal trajecten is

l = c_crit

waarin
l de lower bound is
c_crit het aantal kritieke connecties


Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Our code has been written completely in Python 3.7

requirements.txt lists all packages required to run the codes succesfully.
These can be installed easily via the following pip command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Structure
All Python scripts are located in the folder Code, as well as the script for assessment of the objective function.
The Data folder contains information on all stations and connections
In the folder results will contain all results generated by running the code.

Testing
Use the following command to run the main code:
python main.py
