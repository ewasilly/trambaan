### Description   
In this folder some figures generated by running code can be found.

### alltrajectsNH120 and alltrajectsNL180
In these csv files all traject generated by breadthfirst approach are listed. We wanted to use this as a means of getting quicker acces to the database (because running the breadthfirst on Nationaal"NL" takes several minutes). Unfortunately we were not able to store a traject object into the csv file, only the traject as a string. Which is pretty useless. But for your interest the csv files can still be looked into.


### K spread histograms
After running an algorithm in a for loop the K values of the final set were stored and plotted as a histogram. Remember, the K is calculated over a set of trajects as follows:


**K = p * 10000 - (T * 20 + Min/10)**

- K =  quality
- p =  fraction of critical connections used
- T =  amount of trajects (between 1 and 7)
- Min =  total minutes of the train system (set)


### Hillclimber linecharts
The linecharts apply to a single run of a hillclimber. On the y axis you can see the K-value increase stepwise for each time a change led to a higher score
